Open the terminal on the project root and run the commands below

## Libraries

- [Kingfisher](https://github.com/onevcat/Kingfisher) - A pure Swift library for downloading and caching images. This library does all the hard work when working with images on tableviews/collectionviews, as the reuse is nearly perfect. Doing this by hand would take a tremendous amount of work and still wouldn't work out the way I wanted to.
